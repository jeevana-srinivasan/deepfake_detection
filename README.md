**Multimodal Deepfake Detection**

This project focuses on detecting deepfakes using a multimodal approach, combining both video and audio deepfake detection to improve the robustness and accuracy of detection systems. By analyzing inconsistencies across different modalities, the model aims to identify synthetic media with higher reliability. The model is trained on the FakeAVCeleb dataset, a large-scale dataset containing both audio and video deepfakes. Weighted prediction logic is applied to combine modality-specific predictions and improve the final deepfake detection accuracy.
